## $\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Description}}$
This project gathers nba regular season team data from the seasons 2021-2024 as well as, the over/under lines for each of the respective games during the period. The over/under line in sports betting is also known as "totals".  The totals is a wager on whether the total score is over or under a number set by the sports book.

Example: if the over/under line is set at 200.5 the bettors can wager on whether the total points scored by both teams will be 201 or more (over) or 200 or fewer (under).
