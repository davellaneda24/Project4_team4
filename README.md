# $\color{DarkOrange}{\textsf{Net Gains - The Premier Sports Betting Predictions App}}$


## $\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Description}}$
This project compiles NBA regular season team data from the 2021-2024 seasons, alongside the over/under lines for each respective game within this timeframe. The over/under line, also referred to as "totals" in sports betting, represents a wager on whether the total combined score of both teams in a game will exceed or fall short of a predefined number set by the sportsbook.<br>

Users can select both a home team and an away team, and based on the provided over/under line, a prediction will be made for whether the total score will be over or under the set line. <br>

For instance, if the over/under line is established at 200.5, bettors can place a wager on whether the total points scored by both teams will be 201 or more (over) or 200 or fewer (under).
